              This application is an AI algorithm based Tic-Tac-Toe with
              incremental levels of difficulty. The game uses the Minimax
              algorithm. The app supports two kinds of games:{" "}
              <strong>3x3</strong> and <strong>9x9</strong> <br /> Further for
              the 3x3 tic-tac-toe, there are a total of 4 difficulty levels in
              the game and the ultimate TicTacToe that is unbeatable. Each of
              these difficulties has a gradual increase in the smartness of the
              agent/computer that finally reaches the unbeatable agent.

              In each of the levels, a custom version of the minimax algorithm
              is run, that assigns scores to each configuration based on the
              levels and also restricts the depth of the recursion. <br />
              Here, levels indicate the number of nodes upto which the agent can
              search/traverse in the recursion tree.

                  Apart from the crossover win states, we now allow the agent to

                  utilities for those states so that the agent favours them
                  more.

                For the ultimate tic tac toe, we have used the Minimax
                algorithm. The agent traverses the entire tree until the leaf
                node and only then makes a choice. This ensures that the agent
                will definitely take a move that either results in itâ€™s win or a
                tie. We have incorporated an optimization layer as well. We have
                precomputed the utilities for all the configurations of the
                board - that is the nodes of the tree - and have stored them in
                a custom data structure beforehand.

              <p className={overviewStyles.text}>
                An additional feature that we worked to implement was the 9x9
                extreme TicTacToe. The rules for this can be found in the{" "}
                <a href="/rules" style={{ color: "#3b3251" }}>
                  Rule Book
                </a>
                . While designing the agent for this extreme tic tac toe
                version, we have a trade-off between the smartness and the
                response time. This is primarily because, both the depth and the
                breadth of the recursion tree that is to be explored now is
                larger in the case of 9x9. We have included optimizations to
                enable the agent to play mindfully with a shorter response time.
                The last section mentions about the optimizations.
